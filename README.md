# myportfolio-react

## Description

- This project is to build a web application for the portfolio of work has been developed to showcase the skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position using React.
- React.js, commonly referred to as simply React, is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, which make up different parts of a web application’s interface. Each component can represent a specific part of the UI, such as a navigation bar, footer, or main content area1. React is declarative, efficient, and flexible, making it a popular choice for front-end development
- This project is deployed on Netlify and the repository used is GitHub.
- During this implementation, I was able to apply my knowledge on React.js and Netlify

## Installation

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, select Pages on the left side of the page. On the GitHub Pages screen, choose main in the dropdown under Branch. Click the Save button.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

6. To ensure that the node_modules folder is not pushed in the GITHUB, the .gitignore has to be updated and included.
